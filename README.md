What link exists between smoking and cardiovascular disease?
According to the 2014 Surgeon General's Report on smoking and health, smoking is a major cause of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and accounts for one in every four CVD-related fatalities. Early CVD symptoms
can appear in smokers of less than five cigarettes per day as well. The risk of cardiovascular disease rises
with daily cigarette consumption and prolonged smoking.

In what ways does smoking impair cardiovascular health?
The chemicals in cigarette smoke inflame and swell the blood vessel lining cells. This may cause blood vessel
narrowing and increase the risk of developing a number of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart
disease (CHD). It happens when clots or plaque constrict the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.
Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that cause blood in veins and arteries to thicken and clot. A clot-related
blockage may cause a heart attack and unexpected death. 

Research question:
As tobacco is mostly used for smoking due to its high nicotine content, along with other risk factors that may
be possible causes of CHD, we conduct a statistical exercise to evaluate if tobacco usage has any impact on
the diagnosis of CHD. We select "Replication Data for: South African Heart Disease" as a dataset from the
HARVARD Dataverse
